# Agentic Mode Workflow to streamline the Code Development Framework

This document outlines a structured process for implementing solutions in agentic mode. The goal is to ensure thorough understanding, user approval at key stages, and avoidance of assumptions.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Completely understand the problem statement from the user's query.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable components.
- Identify the key concepts and terms related to the problem.
- Research and gather information on each component to build a comprehensive understanding.
- Synthesize the information to form a coherent understanding of the overall problem in high-level pointers.
- Review and validate the understanding by cross-referencing with reliable sources or experts in the field.

## Step 2: Seek User Approval for Understanding
- Present the synthesized understanding to the user for review.
- Ask for clarifications if any aspects are unclear or if assumptions might be creeping in.
- Proceed only once the user approves the understanding.

## Step 3: Plan the Implementation
- Outline how you will implement the solution, including key steps, tools, and potential challenges.
- Present this plan to the user for review and feedback.

## Step 4: Seek User Approval for Implementation Plan
- Ask for clarifications or adjustments based on user input.
- Proceed to implementation only once the user approves the plan.

## Step 5: Implement the Solution
- Execute the approved plan step by step.
- Provide updates or intermediate results to the user as needed.
- If issues arise during implementation, pause and seek user input.

## General Notes
- Throughout the process, avoid making assumptions. Always ask the user for clarifications if anything is ambiguous.
- This workflow is iterative: if new information emerges, revisit earlier steps as necessary.
- Document all approvals and changes for traceability.
